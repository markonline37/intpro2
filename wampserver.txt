Installing and configuring of wampserver

wampserver: http://www.wampserver.com/en/
Click the download link, there's an option to download directly at the end of the first paragraph.
Download and install.
It will ask you what browser and text editor you want to use as default during install I recommend changing both to something else.

Once installed:
In the system tray will be a big W icon, left click and select www directory.
In the folder that opened create a new directory - I named mine: intpro2
You'll be using this directory a lot so it may be worthwhile creating a shortcut for this folder
    Right click the folder and select create shortcut, drag the shortcut wherever is easiest for you.
	
Open up the folder you created and right click the address bar and then select copy address as text.

Left click the Wamp icon in the system tray again and select Localhost or open up your web browser and type in localhost.

This is the Wamp splash page, at the bottom middle you should see the project you created earlier.
Click Add a Virtual Host at the very bottom left
    Give it a name
	Paste in the absolute path that you copied earlier.
	Click Start the creat... Button.
	
This time Right click the wamp icon in the system tray, hover over tools and select Restart DNS
The Wamp icon changes colour then goes back to green.

Now if you type in the name of your project into the browser (intpro2 for me) it will open the folder and treat it as a website.
    There's nothing in there currently so it won't do anything.
	
It's all installed/configured now. 

You can access phpmyadmin through the system tray or the wamp splash screen

Default login is username: root (with no password by default)
